# 🎉 Guest List Manager

This is a simple project that lets you manage a list of guests for an event. You can add people, assign them a category (like friend, family, or colleague), mark if they’re attending, and remove them when needed.

## 📘 Description

The Guest List Manager is a small JavaScript app made to help keep track of who’s invited and who’s confirmed for your event. It works in the browser and doesn't need any database or backend — everything is handled with basic JS, HTML, and CSS.

You can only add up to 10 guests, which is helpful for managing small events or personal gatherings.
